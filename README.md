# AuraTattoo
----
The purpose of this project is to create a Website for the Tattoo store. 
We want to have a modern and sleek look with nice animations.

### The client is interested the most with:
- Automatic Instagram Feed
- Booking form
- CMS - that she can edit some parts of the website by herself [main text on homepage, residents, some pictures]

### Proposed tech stack
!!! Remember this is your project - you can propose some other technologies 
- NextJs
- React form hook
- EmailJs
- Sass
- Animation lib.
- Rowy / Hygraph [or other CMS]
- Google Analytics

Although she creates her works with both machine and single needles, her preferred and beloved technique is hand poke. Being aware of every single dot put under one's skin makes this process unique for her.

Besides tattooing Weronika works as a photographer and DOP, her visual works are available at [ovors.com](https://www.ovors.com)`,

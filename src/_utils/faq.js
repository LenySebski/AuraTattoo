    question: "How should I prepare for a tattoo session?",
    answer: `#### HOW TO PREPARE FOR A SESSION
- **You must bring ID with you**. This must be government-issued ID, such as a driving licence, passport, residence permit or national ID card (we cannot accept student cards or similar).

- We are a **shoe-free** studio to make you feel **relaxed** and **at home**. Feel free to bring your own slippers or warm socks!

- Hydrate yourself inside and out, it is vital for skin condition while tattooing. Get a good night's sleep and eat before getting a tattoo.

- Put on clothes that provide access to the part of the body on which we will work.

- If possible wear plain clothes in calm or dark shades (preferably white, grey, beige, brown, black).

- Full day session is tiring, it is advisable not to plan any activities in the evening after a long session.

- Bring snack and drink with you.

#### WHAT **NOT** TO DO:

- **Drinking alcohol or taking drugs the night before is not advised (and it is illegal to tattoo anyone who is under the influence of either).** Having alcohol in your system thins your blood and will mean that you will **bleed a lot** during the tattooing process. Drinking soon after the process **can prevent your skin from healing properly, which can damage the tattoo**.

- Please **do not arrive more than 5 minutes early** for your appointment.

- Please **come alone to your appointment** unless agreed in advance with your Artist. We're a small studio and do not have space for lots of additional visitors.

- Avoid any strenuous exercise for 4-7 days after your tattoo (this can lead to infection or could damage the skin).

- Please do not apply numbing cream without speaking to your Tattoo Artist in advance (these creams can change the properties of your skin and in some extreme cases cause burning).

    question: "What is the tattoo aftercare process?",
    answer: `#### WHEN THE "SECOND SKIN"

1. Leave the dressing for 1-3 days after application. Plasma, blood and excess of ink will leak under the dressing, so the tattoo look "blurred". This is a natural process, so there is no reason to panic. :)

You may need to remove dressing earlier when it comes off, when it gets dirty, when there is too much liquid inside, when there was an allergy.

It's best to remove the dressing in the shower with lukewarm running water. Lift one of the corners and allow water to get between the foil and the skin.

• Wash the tattoo with neutral, fragrance free soap

• Use a Clean **Paper Towel** to dry your tattoo by gently PATTING the area. Do not RUB your tattoo at all as it may cause irritation.

• Pat a thin layer of cream for healing a tattoo (we recommend hustle butter or helosan). Do not apply too much! You can soak the tattoo with the cream. Thin layer will allow your tattoo to breath and heal properly.

Repeat these 3 things 3 times a day for 14-28 days (depending on the tattoo size/style and how quickly it heals; artist will advise)

Each person's skin heals differently, but for a period of 2 weeks we try to take care of this place especially, moisturising it with ointment several times a day (about 3 times a day as said above).

#### WHAT TO REMEMBER:

• For the first week, we try to avoid (when you can) wear clothing in this place (mentioning thighs bras etc.) or try to wear clothes loose and made of natural fabrics

• Do not drink alcohol for 3 days after tattooing

• For the first week give up excessive physical activity

• For the first 3-4 weeks, do not take a bath (quick shower is fine), do not soak your tattoo (avoid swimming pools and other public water reservoirs, sauna, hot yoga, etc)

• It's VERY IMPORTANT to not scratch, pick or peel the skin as this could cause wounds and scarring or missing some ink.

• Do not expose the tattoo to the sun and tanning beds for a month

• ALWAYS apply a tattoo filter (SPF 50) before exposure to the sun (you can use it after 3 weeks from getting your tattoo)

#### WHEN BASIC PLASTIC FILM:

1. First foil is removed after 3-4 hours.

2. Gently wash the place with lukewarm water and antiseptic soap (neutral soap).

3. Use a Clean **Paper Towel** to set your tattoo by gently PATTING the area. Do not RUB your tattoo at all as it may cause irritation.

4. Pat a thin layer of cream for healing a tattoo or bephanten cream. Do not apply too much! You can also soak the tattoo with the cream.

5. Replace the plastic film.

Repeat everything approximately in every 2-3 hours for the first 2-3 days after tattooing. Also put films on the first 2 nights.

Whenever you are in clean environment let your skin breath without the plastic as much as possible.

    question: "What should I know for my first tattoo?",
    answer: `We hear you. Getting first tattoo can be nerve-racking and we do everything  to make the experience as easeful and pleasurable as possible through communication and intentional, grounded space holding. We can take our time and we will walk you patiently step-by-step through the process of getting your tattoo. Your wellness and comfort are important. Feel welcome to be as vulnerable as you need, ask questions. Remember there is no silly question. This connection and vulnerable space is what makes tattooing so special and intimate and we are highly aware of that dynamic. As mentioned in our policy statement, if it is something that would make you feel more calm you are allowed to come with one supportive person to your appointment.

Additionally, because it is your first tattoo it is important that you read section **[How should I prepare for a tattoo session?](?q=0#qst-0)** and [What is the tattoo aftercare process?](?q=1#qst-1) to ensure you know what getting and healing a fresh tattoo involves. `,

    question: "What is your individual attendance and shoeless policy?",
    answer: `
In light of prioritizing both your comfort and the artistic endeavor, we at Aura kindly request your attendance at scheduled appointments either **individually or with a maximum of one accompanying person**. Our atelier is not a large commercial space. Hence, to ensure a serene and intimate environment conducive to both creativity and personalized attention, also to keep environment safe and clean, we prefer to limit the number of individuals present.

To preserve the utmost purity within our studio, we uphold a **"shoeless policy"** that we earnestly request your compliance with. For your convenience, sanitized slippers are available on-site, meticulously disinfected after each client, ensuring an environment of impeccable cleanliness.

We deeply appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

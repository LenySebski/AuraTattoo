                    <li><p>
                        Legal obligations: Processing Personal Data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation

                <p>In any case, the Company will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
                    processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
